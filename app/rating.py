"""Composite per-channel-per-period Rating — shared by the Folder Stats view
(app.ui.folder_stat_view, which computes it per period bucket within one
folder) and the Config screen's Folders MD export (app.ui.config_view, which
reuses it so a channel's exported Rating matches what Folder Stats would show
for the same folder/period). Kept here, not in either view, so neither has to
import UI code from the other to reuse it.

score_entries() takes one period bucket's entries — one dict per channel,
with `views`, `shares`, `reactions`, `posts` (all period *totals* /
counts), `quality` (see app.scoring) and `viral_share` already filled in —
and adds a `score` key to each, in [0, 1]:

    views/post  = views ÷ posts (mean views *per post*), min-max normalized
                 against the other entries in the same bucket, weighted
                 VIEWS_PER_POST_WEIGHT. Per-post, not the period total, so a
                 channel can't climb the rating just by posting 3× as often.
    total reach = log10 of the absolute period views — but *capped* at
                 (views ÷ posts) × the folder's median post count, so a
                 channel gets credit for the audience it actually delivers
                 without a flood of low-value posts past the folder's normal
                 cadence buying any more. Min-max normalized, weighted
                 TOTAL_REACH_WEIGHT. This is the counterweight to views/post:
                 a small channel with a lucky per-post average still loses
                 here to a genuine heavyweight, and log-scale keeps one
                 giant from compressing everyone else to zero.
    engagement = (shares + REACTIONS_ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHT × reactions) ÷ posts,
                 min-max normalized the same way, weighted ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHT
                 — also per-post. Reactions count for only 5% of their raw
                 value (vs. shares in full) because reaction counts are the
                 easier of the two to artificially pump; a repost is a more
                 costly, harder to fake action.
    quality    = per-post gauge score (app.scoring, `viral_excess=False` —
                 reach is already the views + virality terms), averaged
                 per channel per period as a *median* (the stored top-N row
                 pool is skewed toward the channel's best posts, so a mean
                 runs high; the median is steadier), min-max normalized,
                 weighted QUALITY_WEIGHT.
    forward_rate = shares ÷ views (forwards per view — how often a viewer
                 thought the post worth re-sharing, size-independent),
                 min-max normalized, weighted FORWARD_RATE_WEIGHT. Separates
                 "big loyal audience that taps a reaction" from "content
                 people actually spread".
    virality   = an absolute (not normalized) curve over viral_share — see
                 virality_component() — weighted by virality_weight(viral_
                 share), which itself ramps from VIRALITY_WEIGHT_MIN to
                 VIRALITY_WEIGHT_MAX as viral_share climbs to 15%, so a
                 highly viral channel isn't just scored well on virality,
                 virality also matters more to its rating

`views ÷ posts` and `engagement ÷ posts` divide by max(posts, RATE_MIN_POSTS)
so a channel with only a handful of posts in the period can't post one lucky
hit and top the bucket on an "average" of n=2.

The *_WEIGHT constants are relative, not a budget that has to sum to 1 — the
composite is their weighted average, always divided by their actual total
(VIEWS_PER_POST_WEIGHT + TOTAL_REACH_WEIGHT + ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHT +
QUALITY_WEIGHT + FORWARD_RATE_WEIGHT + virality_weight) for that entry. That
division is the one and only
normalization step, not a conditional safety net for an edge case — so each
constant's *relative* size is a direct, honest read of how much it swings the
score at every viral_share level, with no hidden threshold past which some
other weight silently stops being honored. (An earlier version instead gave
views only whatever budget happened to be left over after fixing the other
three to sum near 1 — which went negative, and floored at 0, for most
realistic viral_share values once those three were tuned up; a floor-at-0
"safety net" that fires on almost every entry isn't one. Giving views its own
explicit weight instead removes that failure mode entirely, not just patches
its symptom.)

On top of the capped "total reach" term, `reach_bonus()` adds a small flat
lift for a channel whose period `views` run *well* above the folder's median
channel: nothing up to REACH_BONUS_START× the median, ramping to
REACH_BONUS_MAX by REACH_BONUS_FULL×. Additive, applied last (after the
penalties below), capped at 1.0 — it only nudges the very top of the folder
and never reshuffles the channels under the threshold.

Finally, `_confidence()` scales the whole score down linearly once the
period post count drops below CONFIDENCE_MIN_POSTS — a rating built off 3
posts, one of which happened to land, is noise, not a ranking a near-dormant
channel should ride. (The "small channel with lucky per-post numbers" problem
is handled structurally by the capped total-reach term above, not here.)

A channel with ~0 reposts in the period is a red flag views/reactions/
quality alone don't catch — it suggests whatever views or apparent virality
the channel shows weren't corroborated by anyone actually sharing the
content. So its viral_share is first cut by ZERO_REPOSTS_PENALTY *before*
the virality curve above (denying it credit for an apparently-viral post),
and the same penalty is then applied again as a flat cut to the whole
composite score.

A channel whose feed *is* largely other people's posts gets a second,
separate demerit. Reposts (posts forwarded in from another channel) are
already dropped from all four scored terms — see app.scoring and
app.tools.channel_stat._is_repost — so a repost-heavy channel isn't
credited for that borrowed reach. On top of that, `repost_share` (the
percent of the period's posts that were reposts) applies a smooth flat cut
to the composite score via repost_share_penalty(): nothing up to
REPOST_SHARE_PENALTY_START (20%), ramping linearly to REPOST_SHARE_PENALTY_MAX
by REPOST_SHARE_PENALTY_FULL (30%) and holding there — a channel coasting on
reposts is doing less original work than its post volume suggests, and its
rating should say so. Checkpoints fetched before per-post reposts were
tracked report repost_share 0 and are unaffected until refetched.
