"""Fetch and cache the first-photo/video thumbnail for a set of posts —
used by the High-Quality Posts view so its cards can show a preview image
without every channel needing to carry full media in its checkpoint
(nothing else in this app downloads media; checkpoints only ever store
text/counts).

Deliberately separate from `channel_stat.run_channel_stat`: it's triggered
on demand by a button in the view itself (only for the posts currently on
screen), not as part of every regular channel fetch — downloading images
for every post of every channel on every fetch would be slow and bloat
storage for a feature most people won't use every time.

    `channel` is whatever identifier the post's checkpoint already carries
    (@username, -100… id, or a t.me link — same as build_post_link and
    resolve_entity handle elsewhere). `id` is the post's *canonical* id
    (what the checkpoint and the card both key off), `ids` is every
    message id merged into that post (the same post can be a whole album —
    see channel_stat.py) — a post's `id` alone isn't necessarily the album
    member that actually carries a photo/video, so every candidate is
    tried until one downloads successfully, but the result is always saved
    under the *canonical* id so the view can find it again.

    Downloads the *smallest* thumbnail (not the full-res image/video —
    this is for a small card preview) for the first candidate that has one
    (photo, video, or round/circle video note), skipping posts that
    already have a cached thumbnail. Text-only posts, or posts whose media
    Telegram doesn't expose a thumbnail for, are silently skipped."""
