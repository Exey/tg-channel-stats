"""Refresh just the `links` field on already-stored checkpoints — used by
Config's "Refresh mentions" folder action.

Same targeted-refetch shape as comments_refresh.run_comments_refresh: reuses
each channel's already-stored checkpoint `rows` (its top-N pool — see
channel_stat.py's module docstring) and re-reads each post's message
entities via a batched `get_messages(ids=...)`, rather than a full re-scan.
Only rows that already have text (`full_text` or `text`) are worth
re-checking — a post with no caption at all can't carry a link either, and
this is exactly the field `links` (see channel_stat._extract_links) was
missing from before that helper existed. Saves each channel's checkpoint
back to disk as soon as that channel's batch finishes, same reason as
comments_refresh: a folder with many channels doesn't lose all its progress
if cancelled or interrupted partway through.
