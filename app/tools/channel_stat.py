"""Fetch a channel: rank its posts by engagement *and* compute activity stats.

This is the extracted-and-extended `channel_top` tool. In a single pass over
the chosen period it does two jobs at once:

* engagement ranking (from tg-super-admin's channel_top) — per-post views,
  reactions and forwards ("private reposts"), album-merged, keeping the union
  of the top-N by each metric so the on-screen table can re-sort and still
  show the true leaders. Public reposts are fetched only for that pool. Each
  post is also flagged as a `repost` when it was forwarded in from another
  channel (see _is_repost) — content-quality scoring and the Rating drop
  those so a channel can't pad its score with someone else's viral post.

* activity analytics (ported from telegram-channel-analyzer) — member count,
  creation date, posts/day, posts-with-media share, average/max views, and
  hour-of-day / day-of-week / month distributions for the charts.

The whole thing is returned as one JSON payload, which the app stores as a
per-channel checkpoint (see app.store).
