"""Refresh just the `comments` count on already-stored checkpoints — used by
Config's "Refresh comments" folder action.

A full re-fetch (`channel_stat.run_channel_stat`) re-walks a channel's whole
history, member count, activity distributions, everything — overkill (and
slow) when all that's actually stale is one field added after a channel was
last fetched (see channel_stat.py's `_comment_total`). This instead reuses
each channel's already-stored checkpoint `rows` (its top-N pool — see
channel_stat.py's module docstring) and just re-reads the comment count for
those exact post ids via a batched `get_messages(ids=...)`, same technique
as media_fetch.run_thumbnail_cache. Unlike a tool that returns one big JSON
payload for the UI to save, this saves each channel's checkpoint back to
disk itself as soon as that channel's batch finishes, so a folder with many
channels doesn't lose all its progress if cancelled or interrupted partway
through.
