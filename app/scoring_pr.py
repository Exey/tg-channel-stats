"""Mutual PR (ad-swap) scoring — shared by app.ui.mutual_pr_view, which lists
every tracked channel with an estimated ad-post follower-gain forecast and a
"best days to post" pick, to help decide which channels are worth trading ad
posts with.

Two layers live here: the per-channel ad-post forecast (ad_forecast and
everything it calls), and — at the very bottom, under the "Mutual PR partner
matching" header — the per-*pair* compatibility score behind that view's
"MPR Pairs" / "Пары ВП" table (rank_mutual_pr_pairs), shown on screen and
appended to its Markdown export.

The app has no real ad-campaign outcome data anywhere: ChannelStore keeps one
point-in-time snapshot per channel (no follower-history, no growth-over-time),
and every post record stores a single final view count with no view-age
curve (see app.tools.channel_stat). So unlike app.scoring's per-post formula
(tuned against this app's own real median), the forecast below is built on
constants that are genuinely just documented heuristics, not measurements —
they exist so a forecast can be produced at all, not because they were
calibrated against real ad-swap results:

    AD_VIEW_CURVE: assumed fraction of a post's eventual (settled) reach
        that has landed by each horizon. Shaped to match the accumulation
        curve implied by one real channel's own observed ad performance
        (~60% within 24h, ~75% by 48h, most of the rest trickling in over
        the following two weeks) — generalized into a fixed curve since no
        per-channel view-age data exists to calibrate it per channel.
    FOLLOW_CONVERSION_BASE: assumed fraction of a post's reach that converts
        into a new follower for an *ad* post specifically (as opposed to the
        channel's own organic content), scaled by the channel's own content
        quality (see follow_conversion_rate) since a channel that engages
        its own audience well presumably also converts outside traffic
        better — but only mildly (INTEREST_WEIGHT is deliberately small):
        calibrated against two channels with real known ad-swap outcomes,
        reach (avg_views_settled) alone already predicted their ~2-3x gap
        almost exactly (2.63x raw reach ratio vs. a stated real ~2-3x
        follower-gain ratio), despite one having much lower measured
        content quality than the other. Quality still nudges the estimate,
        it just isn't allowed to fight a clear reach difference the way an
        earlier, much larger weight (plus an added virality multiplier)
        did — that combination crushed a 2.63x-reach channel down to near
        parity with a smaller one, which is what prompted this recalibration.

These are ordinary module constants specifically so they're easy to retune
once real ad-swap outcomes are available to calibrate against — logging
what an actual ad-swap post does (follower count before, then at 24h/48h/
week/month) is the real fix, not anything below; there's currently no
pipeline for that, so everything here stays a heuristic in the meantime.

Reach (avg_views_settled) is used directly and unmodified as the forecast's
total-reach basis — not blended or capped against a shorter, noisier recent
window. An earlier version tried grounding the "month" figure in a 30-60-
day-old post sample specifically, but that window is small enough (a
handful of posts, fewer for an infrequent poster) that a single big post
landing in it could double the estimate; avg_views_settled, averaged over
a channel's entire settled history, doesn't have that problem and needs no
compensating cap to fix it.

Per-horizon adjustments (currently just a rare-posting channel's post
lingering un-buried and so gathering reach more gradually) are applied as
REDISTRIBUTION of one fixed total across AD_VIEW_CURVE's fractions, not as
independent per-horizon multipliers — see ad_forecast. An earlier version
also tilted 24h's fraction toward 48h's by content quality, independently
scaled 24h's own conversion rate harder than the other horizons', which
could (and on real checkpoints, did) let the 24h figure exceed the 48h one
— a cumulative-forecast ordering that makes no sense regardless of what
the constants get tuned to. Redistributing a fixed total is what makes
that impossible by construction rather than by clamping after the fact:
month's fraction is always exactly 1.0 (that's its definition — "all of
it has landed"), and every earlier fraction is built by shrinking toward
0, never past its own next-larger neighbor.

ad_forecast_range() reports a low/high band alongside the point estimate
— a crude, honestly-labeled uncertainty range (not a fitted statistical
interval, since there's no outcome data yet to fit one against) reflecting
the two dominant unverified constants above.

# Everything above forecasts what *one* channel does with an ad post. This
# section instead scores a *pair* of channels for how good an ad swap
# between them would be — the "MPR Pairs" / "Пары ВП" table (the on-screen
# card and the section appended to app.ui.mutual_pr_view's Markdown export).
#
# It uses only metrics this app already has (followers, the 24h forecast
# above, best_days above, and whether the two share a folder). It does NOT
# know whether the two channels have already cross-promoted each other —
# there's no mention graph here. When that data exists, filter those pairs
# out before calling rank_mutual_pr_pairs (or multiply a pair's score by 0),
# the same way an already-swapped pair adds nothing.
#
# The four weights are a plain weighted sum and sum to 1.0, so a pair's
# score is directly in [0, 1]:
#
#     score = W_SIZE     × size_parity        (fair-exchange: similar reach)
#           + W_QUALITY   × quality_parity     (both convert views similarly)
#           + W_DAY       × day_overlap        (their best posting days line up)
#           + W_FOLDER    × (1 if same folder) (same niche → relevant audience)
